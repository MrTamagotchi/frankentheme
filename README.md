# frankentheme
A WP starter theme initally based on [Bones Theme](https://themble.com/bones/) and then [Blankslate](http://tidythemes.com/) and most recently [Tonik](http://labs.tonik.pl/theme/). It also includes bits and pieces found here and there or gifted from friends. Many would call it an immoral and unethical abomination. I think its pretty cute. 

## Features (not bugs)
* Dead simple structure
* PHP components with support for passing data (not borrowed from Tonik even though they have a nice system for it as well)
* Cool, modern tooling, such as:
  * Bundling, task running and all that jazz with Webpack
  * Watching and serving with Webpack Dev Server and Browser Sync
  * ES6 with Babel
  * Sass with Sass
  * Unit testing with Mocha and Chai
  * Coverage reports with Istanbul/NYC

## Disclaimer
This is not meant to be an official theme in any way sort or form. Files are not always consistent, and there are an insane amount of TODO's and FIX ME's in the backlog. One day my baby will be complete, but in the meantime I'll keep it here for future reference.
